## Documentation: Air Quality Monitoring System and Pollution Data Analysis

### 1. Introduction

This documentation outlines the implementation of an air quality monitoring system using an ESP8266 microcontroller, various sensors, and MQTT for data transmission. Additionally, it includes analysis of pollution data using Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

### 2. Hardware Components

- ESP8266 microcontroller
- MQ135 air quality sensor
- LCD display
- Buzzer

### 3. Software Components

- Arduino IDE for ESP8266 programming
- PubSubClient library for MQTT communication
- LiquidCrystal library for interfacing with the LCD display

### 4. Design Choices

#### 4.1. Sensor Selection

- **MQ135**: This sensor is chosen for its ability to detect a wide range of gases, including ammonia, nitrogen oxides, benzene, and carbon dioxide, which are common pollutants.
  
#### 4.2. Communication Protocol

- **MQTT (Message Queuing Telemetry Transport)**: MQTT is chosen for its lightweight and efficient publish-subscribe messaging protocol, which is suitable for IoT applications where bandwidth and power consumption are critical factors.

#### 4.3. Data Visualization

- **Matplotlib and Seaborn**: These libraries are selected for data visualization due to their versatility and ability to generate clear and informative plots.

### 5. Implementation Details

#### 5.1. Arduino Implementation

- The Arduino sketch sets up Wi-Fi connection and MQTT client for data transmission.
- Sensor readings are obtained from the MQ135 sensor and displayed on an LCD screen.
- If the air quality exceeds a predefined threshold, an alarm is triggered using a buzzer.
- Data is published to an MQTT topic ("air-quality-logs") along with a timestamp.

#### 5.2. Python Implementation

- The Python script reads pollution data from a CSV file.
- It preprocesses the data by removing unnecessary columns and formatting timestamps.
- Hourly pollution levels are plotted for Mumbai, Hyderabad, and Chennai using Matplotlib.
- Pairplots and jointplots are generated using Seaborn for further analysis.

### 6. Challenges Faced

- **Sensor Calibration**: Ensuring accurate readings from the MQ135 sensor required calibration and understanding its response to different gases.
- **Integration with MQTT**: Establishing a stable connection with the MQTT broker and handling reconnections in case of network issues posed some challenges during implementation.

### 7. Future Improvements

- **Real-Time Data Visualization**: Implementing real-time visualization of sensor data for immediate feedback.
- **Dynamic Thresholds**: Introducing dynamic threshold adjustments based on historical data analysis to improve accuracy in detecting air quality anomalies.
- **User Interface**: Developing a user-friendly interface for better interaction and control over the monitoring system.

### 8. Conclusion

The combined implementation of an air quality monitoring system and pollution data analysis provides valuable insights into environmental conditions. By leveraging IoT technologies and data analysis techniques, it contributes to efforts aimed at understanding and mitigating air pollution for healthier living environments.
